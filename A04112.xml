         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Sometime the holy Ghoſt giueth ſome ſcripture a name aboue other names, as <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth the 120 Pſalme and 14 Pſalmes following, <hi>ſongs of Degrees,</hi> not for that the <hi>Leuites</hi> did raiſe the tune in ſinging thoſe Pſalmes, for theſe and other Pſalmes had the like tune, nor yet becauſe they were ſung on the ſtayers of the temple, for <hi>Salomon</hi> built the temple after thoſe Pſalmes were ſtiled by that name, but becauſe (as a learned writer of our time hath well obſerued) they were excellent Pſalmes of a higher degree, and more ſpeciall vſe.</p>
                  <p>But neither note, nor name, nor any thing elſe can commend vnto vs any eſpeciall ſcripture, whereby to moue attention ſo much as this which is <hi>ſuperlatiue</hi> to them all, God deliuered the law with his owne mouth, God did write it with his owne fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſo that he might ſay for the one as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to his brethren; <note n="o" place="margin">Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 45. 12</note>

                  <p>3.

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore be not like hounds, which haue their eares hanging towards the earth, by reaſon whereof the ſound and voice cannot ſo ſoone enter; much leſſe be like the deafe adder, <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 58. 4</note> which ſtoppeth her eares, but be like the little birds which peirk vp their heads when the dam doth bring them meat, and be ready to ſay with <hi>Samuel</hi> when God ſpeaketh, <note n="x" place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 10.</note>

                  <p>Therefore the Pope is to blame two waies, 1. In leauing out one commandement, 2.

Wee haue a prouerbe, happy is the Childe, when the father goes to the diuell, for example, the father not ſo much as rouing at God, makes the world his ſtanding marke, he neuer thinkes of compaſſing heauen, but as Satan came from compaſſing the earth to and fro and from walking in it; ſo hee will compaſſe earthly things for him and his, and hauing the greedy worme vnder his tongue with <hi>Eſops</hi> Dogge, would ingroſſe the world for himſelfe and his iſſue, now no way comes amiſſe to wealth, vſury, extortion, oppreſſion, ſacriledge, ſwearing, lying, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telty, as porters ſhall bring in his gaine, now poore <hi>Naboth</hi> ſhall not hold his owne, becauſe <hi>Ahab</hi> is ſicke of his Vineyarde: like enough ſuch a father goes to the diuell, but how is his Childe happy? you will ſay, becauſe he ſhall gather all theſe riches which his father raked together, yet I ſay not happy, for many times we ſee there comes a ſonne, that is as good with a forke as his father with a rake, as good a ſpendall, as his father get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and ſcorning to thinke of the troubles and ſighes of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaping vp his goods, conſumes the fat of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in few yeares, as the leane Kyne did eate vp the fat in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dreame.

We allow not the ſacrifices made for ſoules, nor thoſe <hi>feralia</hi> dedicated to the infernal gods, that they might be pacified with thoſe that are departed, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely ſome will ſay, were I not better pray for them, then to ſay, the diuell goe with them, as good a reaſon, as if a theefe being blamed for robbing a man vpon Shooters hill, or in Stangate hole, ſhould reply and ſay, were I not better robbe him, then kill him, of euils euery one is to be auoyded.

                     <p>1 I ſweare truely ſaith one, this is a ſalue for his ſore not to heale it but to hide it.</p>
                     <p>2 I ſhall not be beleeued without an oath ſaith another, here is another whoriſh complexion dawbed on, that this ſinne might not appeare in it owne colours.</p>
                     <p>3 I meane no body any hurt ſaith a third, but being vſed to let fall an oath now and then, it droppes from me with other words, before I am aware, this is his figge-leafe.</p>

                     <p>To the ſecond ſort, he that truſts thee, will beleeue thee without an oath, he hath experience of thy fidelity, and knoweth that neither feare nor loue, gaine nor loſſe, can make thee eate thy word, and as <note n="k" place="margin">Ioh. 19. 22</note>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14461:80"/> meetetſt with ſome men, with whom thy yea and nay will take no place, whereas thy oath would carry the matter.

                     <p>To the third ſort, which writh and wreath like ſnakes to hide this ſinne, vnder the couert of cuſtome: I ſay it is true, euery ſinne looks for continuall entertainement, where it hath once gotten an haunt, as humours fall towards their old iſſue. We are not weaned from vſuall euils, for cuſtome hardens the heart, and ſtiffens the necke, and ſeareth the conſcience; it is a waterſtreame carrying vs away, and wee had rather follow the courſe of the ſtreame, then row againſt it: aſſoone ſhall a man learne to leaue his mother tongue, as an vſuall oath, it is <hi>faex in dolio,</hi> cleaueth faſt vnto vs, and is almoſt turned into nature: the ſingle corde is ſoone ſnapt a ſunder, the double worke is like to hold out, <note n="m" place="margin">Ec. 4 12.</note> but a three-fold co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Sinne is ſingle in the thought, doubled in the worke, and trebled in cuſtome, it begins in the buds of infirmity, creepeth to the twigs of negligence, and the ſlender twigge becomes a ſtately tree, and that which at firſt with the hands might eaſily be pluckt vp, being ouertaken by cuſtome, groweth to a ſtowt tree of contempt, and will hardly afterward with an axe be cut downe, being readier to breake then to bend, to any good inſtruction: <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 42. 15. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Ioſeph</hi> accuſtoming himſelfe to the oathes of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſweares againe and againe, and if we goe about to repell an accuſtomed ſinne, the diuell doth vexe vs with ſolliciting, and ſay to vs, as the people to <hi>Pilate:</hi>

                        <hi>Doe as thou haſt euer done?</hi> But it is therefore ſafely done, becauſe it is done commonly? ſhall we account this a good plea, wee haue ſo often vſed our tongues to ſwearing, that now we cannot leaue it; this is ſo farre from excuſing vs, that the plea is as bad as the fault, for oathes are precious, and things precious through common vſe loſe their eſtimation: neither will it excuſe vs any more, when we ſhall come to be arreigned before the iudgement ſeate of God, then that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy would the theefe, who being indited, deſired the Iudge he might eſcape vnpuniſhed, for ſtealing was his cuſtome from his youth, and now he could not leaue it, to whom the

                     <p>To the fourth ſort, which ſay they doe not curſe God, nor choppe his heart in peeces, nor throwing his name to the ground, tread and trample it vnder their feet, they doe not like madde dogs fly in their maſters face; indeed they deny not, but that they vſe ſmall oathes as, faith, troth, maſſe, croſſe, or the like, and what matter is it, if they be ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall of theſe trifling oathes, that they pawne them for euery trifle at euery word? To theſe I ſay; Our nature is ſuch, that we ſay of a great ſinne, as <hi>Lot</hi> of the City <hi>Zoar,</hi>

                        <hi>Iames</hi> diſſwades vs from them, becauſe they haue as bad an end, and will haue men refraine them, leſt they fall into condemnation: if no excuſes are ſtrong enough to vphold theſe kind of oathes, which men reckon are of no reckoning; then I need not to take paine to put downe blaſphemous oathes, for being a heauy burden, they fall of themſelues. To blame therefore are thoſe dogs, which make no bones in tearing Gods name, who caſt vp their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to God, as though he were their vnderling, as an angry and fumiſh maſter giues his ſeruant a buffet with his fiſt. The common gameſter, if he be on the looſing ſide, will make his tongue run as faſt againſt God, as Cards, Dice, and bowles doe run againſt him, he will rent and teare his name, as a draper raſheth out a peece of cloath to the buyer, his oathes like hail-ſhot ſhall flye vp and downe the roome, where hee hath his loſſe.

                     <p>But if any did binde two ſinnes together by binding a lye with an oath, few nations had any pitty on him.

                     <p>The ſecond benefit mentioned by the Apoſtle is <hi>Godlines:</hi> A good Prince like <hi>Canutus</hi> before the conqueſt makes lawes by counſell of his ſages, binding his ſubiects one rule of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, well and aduiſedly to hold, not giuing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, either to Iewiſh, Turkiſh, Greekiſh, or Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, though all theſe ſtand for competition of truth, but onely to the Reformed, driuing his ſubiects as a good ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard his ſheepe altogither to greene paſtures, not diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with any, ſince none are exempted by God, denying a tolleration, either to the cauſe of Papiſts, leſt it ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the perſons, or to the perſons leſt it ſhould credit the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The third benefit is <hi>Honeſty:</hi> A good Prince hath a care that there be iuſt and honeſt dealing betwixt man and man, that he which hath much, ſetting honeſty aſide, doth not tyrannize ouer him that hath little, that the fat cow doth not deuoure the leane, and the full eare eate vp the poorer corne, that one doth not by fraude take away anothers land, or by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence hold that, which is none of his, or conuert other mens goods to his vſe: in a word, that men doe not liue like beaſts;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:14461:112"/> but honeſtly and vprightly one with another: theſe three I ſay are great bleſſings, which we enioy vnder good Princes, and the want of any one of them is a great blemiſh in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, peace without godlines is but ſecurity, godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes without honeſty, is but hypocriſie, honeſtie without godlines is but paganiſme, and a gliſtering ſinne, neither godlines nor honeſty without peace can well bee maintained: Godlines is the ſumme of the firſt Table, honeſty the Summe of the ſecond, peace an happy manner of enioying them both.</p>

                     <p>This honour conſiſts not onely in reuerence, in regard whereof it was not lawfull ſo much as to laugh in the Court of the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> and euen the <hi>Romaine</hi> Cenſors diſgraded a Burgeſſe for yawning too wide in their preſence, not onely in allegiance, which is as well pledged vnto him by the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of an oath, as it is due vnto him by bonds of Nature, not onely in feare, in token of all which three, God hath giuen Princes three ſpeciall enſignes of honour, <note n="f" place="margin">Pſ. 21. 3.</note> a Crowne of gold for their ſublimity, for which they muſt bee reuerenced, <note n="g" place="margin">Eze. 19. 11.</note> a Scepter of righteouſneſſe for gouernement, for which they muſt be obeyed; <note n="a" place="margin">Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 13. 4</note> a Sword for vengeance, for which they muſt be feared; but eſpecialy, it conſiſteth in ſeruing him with

                     <p>Secondly, this honour to the King muſt ſhew it ſelfe, in ſeruing him with our liues for his deſenſe: The Bees in their common wealth haue a King, whoſe pallace they frame as faire in ſhew, as ſtrong in ſubſtance, if they finde him fall, they eſtabliſh him againe in his throne with all duty, with all deuotion, they garde him continually for feare hee ſhould miſcary, for loue he ſhould not.

                        <hi>I will ieoparde my life for thy ſake,</hi> and though I ſhould <hi>die with thee, yet I will not deny thee.</hi> Againe this ſerueth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thoſe, who are ſo farre from putting themſelues in ieopardy for their King, that they will aduenture their liues to make him away, as <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> who ſlew <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the Senate houſe, as <hi>Simon</hi> the Monke who firſt dranke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of the Waſſall bowle into which he had conueyed the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of a toade, that he might poyſon King <hi>Iohn,</hi> at the Abby of <hi>Swineſtead.</hi> This in latter time condemneth the Pope, who promiſed earthly and heauenly recompence to <hi>Parry</hi> for offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſeruice to kill Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> It condemneth Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Allen,</hi> who taught that Princes might be violently hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, depoſed from their throne or expoſed to danger.
